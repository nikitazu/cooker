### The Cooker Project

Cooker helps you to play the "Farm" minigame of the "Cookie Clicker" by providing the propabilities and requirements of each plant available in the "Cookie Clicker" game.

The "Cookie Clicker" game could be found at http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker

The data about propabilities and requirements are taken from the "Cookie Clicker Wiki", located at http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Cookie_Clicker_Wiki
